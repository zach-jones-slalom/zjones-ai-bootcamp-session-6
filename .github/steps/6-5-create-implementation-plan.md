# Step 6-5: Create Technical Implementation Plan

## Goal
Use SpecKit to create a technical implementation plan that defines the architecture, tech stack decisions, and approach for implementing the overdue task feature based on your clarified specification.

## Using Claude Sonnet 4.5

For optimal performance during development, you can configure GitHub Copilot to use the Claude Sonnet 4.5 model:

1. In GitHub Copilot chat, click the **Model selector** dropdown (usually showing the current model)
2. Select **Claude Sonnet 4.5** from the available models
3. This model provides superior reasoning and code generation capabilities, ideal for spec-driven development workflows

You can switch back to the default model at any time using the same dropdown.

## Instructions

### :keyboard: Activity: Create a technical implementation plan using SpecKit

1. Open the **Copilot** chat panel and switch to **Agent** mode using the dropdown menu.
2. Select **Claude Sonnet 4.5** from the **Model selector** dropdown for optimal performance.
3. Start a **new chat** to ensure clean context for this step.
4. In the Copilot chat input field, use the SpecKit plan command:
   ```
   /speckit.plan
   ```
4. SpecKit will analyze the specification and clarifications, then create a technical implementation plan that includes:
   - High-level technical approach
   - Architecture decisions
   - Files that need to be modified or created
   - Component modifications needed
   - Integration points
5. Review the generated plan to ensure it aligns with your project structure and existing architecture.
6. Commit and push your changes:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Create implementation plan for overdue todo items"
   git push
   ```

#### Success Criteria
To complete this exercise successfully, ensure that:
- The file `specs/001-*/plan.md` exists with the technical implementation plan
- The plan references your specific project files and structure
- Technical decisions are clearly documented
- The plan respects your project's existing architecture and patterns

If you encounter any issues, you can:
- Make sure you're using Agent mode in Copilot chat
- Verify you started a new chat for this step
- Check that the `/speckit.plan` command was recognized
- Review that `specs/001-*/plan.md` was created
- Ask Copilot to regenerate the plan if needed

## Why?
The implementation plan bridges the gap between the "what" (specification) and the "how" (implementation). It documents technical decisions, architecture choices, and the specific approach for implementing the feature. Having a clear plan ensures that the implementation tasks are well-defined and that the generated code follows your project's patterns and conventions. This also provides a reference for code review and helps ensure consistency across the codebase.
